        Possible HTTP status values of completed or failed jobs.
        * 200 - OK - Successful completion, with a response body.
        * 201 - Created - Successful completion of a create request (POST to collection resource).
        * 202 - Accepted - Job has been started. Response body is a job resource instance. Response status and body are available from job when it completes.
        * 204 - No Content - Successful completion, without a response body.
        * 206 - Partial Content - Paged response to a collection query.
        * 299 - Completed with Messages - Core request completed but has messages for client. Ancillary portions of request may have failed. Few requests should be able to return this, as the intent is for requests to be atomic - to either succeed or roll back on failure.
        * 400 - Invalid Request - The request is incorrect. To the extent possible, validate requests up front and use this code. Details in the response body.
        * 401 - Unauthorized - The request cannot be authenticated.
        * 403 - Forbidden - The request is not allowed for this client.
        * 404 - Not Found - The id value in the request URL is not valid.
        * 409 - Conflict - The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the target resource.
        * 422 - Operation Failed - The request failed during execution.
        * 429 - Too Many Requests - This particular client needs to slow down and take it easy. Retry after a delay.
        * 500 - Internal Error - This means the product has a bug and customer should contact support.
        * 503 - Service Unavailable - The service is temporarily unavailable. Try again later.

        * ERROR - An actual failure condition through which the request could not continue.
        * CRITICAL - A failure with significant impact to the system. Normally failed commands roll back and are just ERROR, but may be used for exceptional cases.
